Changes since version 1.1.1

	* Made choiceVar arg in mnlogit() optional when data is a mlogit.data obj.

	* Added arg alt.subset in mnlogit() call to estimate on a subset of alternatives.

	* Added arg start in mnlogit() call to accept an initial guess for coeffs.
 
	* Added hypothesis tests - 3 MLE test and one test for IIA.
